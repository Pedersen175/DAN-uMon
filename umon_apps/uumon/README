This is an example of a VERY-VERY cut-back version of uMon
(called uuMon, or micro-uMon) for use in a memory-limited system.

Using the config.h file, facilities can be enabled as needed.
If ethernet and flash are not enabled, it fits in under 16K total space
(text/data/bss/stack) and provides xmodem data transfer, DM, PM, MT and
CALL commands.  With both ethernet and flash enabled, it still fits
in less than 32K, and provides a reasonably good set of bootloader-ish
facilities.

Note that this is in the "umon_apps" directory instead of being an
alternative "uMon" build.  There are a few reasons for this...

First, to achieve this small of a build in the uMon source tree would
have required an enourmous amount of "ifdeffing" so I chose to isolate
this version and just cut peices out as needed to make it smaller.

Second, it doesn't support many ports.  Actually, it doesn't support
ANY ports as is.  I built this as an application that can sit ontop
of a Blackfin-based board that I have so that I could test the
functionality out at the command line level.   If you think this is
a useful bootloader, then you'll have to work it into shape as a standalone
bootable image.  The only code you should have to change is config.h,
entry.S, makefile and the stuff under the port directory.
All other portions of the code should be independent of the target.

Have fun...
