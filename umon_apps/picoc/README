This directory contains source and makefile to build the PICO-C
interpreter as a uMon application.  As of this writing, picoc-0.93 is the
version used to build with.  Pico-C is a small/compact C interpreter
written by Zik Saleeba, and available  at http://code.google.com/p/picoc/.

Note that this is not a complete distribution of the pico-c source tree;
it only includes the files that are needed to build for a uMon-based
application.  For a full tree that includes additional source and
documentation refer to the website.

This directory is built so that the 'pcc' application can be installed
as an executable file into TFS and then used to run another '.c' file
in TFS.  So, for example, if you had the file try.c in tfs...

int i;
for(i=0;i<5;i++)
   printf("i=%d\n",i);

and at the uMon prompt you typed:

uMON>pcc try.c

the output would be...

i=0
i=1
i=2
i=3
i=4

Application Exit Status: 0 (0x0)
uMON>


Note that this is an EXTREMELY simple example.  For more examples
refer to the tests directory that comes with the official picoc 
distribution.

Zik has incorporated support in the main tree of picoc to support a
build that can be used by uMon, so its pretty easy to get started.
If you just use this tree, it will work as is.  If you choose to get
a more recent version of pico-c you can simply put the new release under
this directory and set the PICOCDIR variable in the makefile appropriately.

Refer to makefile for details on how to build for various CPU architectures
and target configurations.  As of this writing it has been tested on
big (PPC) and little (Blackfin) endian CPUs.
