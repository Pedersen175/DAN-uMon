Welcome to MicroMonitor!


This is the top-level of the MicroMonitor CVS.

There are three main directories:
umon_main:
  This is the common code reusable on various targets as the core
  of MicroMonitor's functionality.
umon_ports:
  This directory contains the public ports of MicroMonitor.  Each
  subdirectory contains the makefile and target-specific code for
  one uMon port.
umon_apps:
  This code provides a few different application examples for use
  after the bootmonitor is built and running on your target.  The
  best place to go there is umon_apps/demo.  This directory contains
  the source and makefile that support building a basic application
  for any target supported by MicroMonitor.  

To get started, refer to umon_main/README.

# SVN User Notes:
#
As of release 1.17 the uMon tree is under SVN (instead of CVS).
To diff a file ignoring whitespace...
	svn diff --diff-cmd diff -x -uw filename

To retrieve the current revision...
	svn info -r HEAD

To review recent changes...
	svn log -vr 2186:2100	(range may vary)

To diff a file relative to the HEAD, run...
	svn diff -r HEAD filename

To create a new uMon release...
	1 Retrieve a "fresh" tree from SVN so that we don't miss a file
	  that may be in the local directory, but not committed.
	2 Run 'make rebuild 2>&1 | tee make.out' under umon_ports and
	  verify that the build was clean.
	3 Update common/version.h
	4 When committing the verion.h file, note the SVN release and
	  make a note of it at the bottom of this file.  Then commit this
          file.  
	5 Copy the umon tree to umon-X.YY, then remove all .svn and
	  .subversion directories.  Run 'make clobber' under umon_ports
	  and umon_main/host.
	6 Create new tarball.

If these instructions are followed, then in theory, this file will be
the last committed file in the release; hence the Revision of this file
(keyword below) can be used as the release point of reference...

Revision: $Revision: 2387 $
